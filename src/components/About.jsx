            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br></br>
            <p>I am a full-stack software engineer with strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills who thrives in collaborating with cross-functional teams. With a passion for climate and social impact, I work on freelance and open source projects that utilize today's most in-demand technologies.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>As a current Out in Tech mentee, I collaborate closely with a software engineering mentor to gain professional insight and build a project utilizing Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Node.js that helps school districts calculate their tax credits and deductions to electrifying their buildings and other assets and making them energy efficient. In the social impact space, I’m developing features and fixing bugs for an open source project called PolicyEngine that computes the impacts of public policy on household benefits.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>In my freelance work, I’ve gained valuable insight on working with cross-functional teams. As a freelance software engineer for Chippy, I’m a part of a team of 6 programmers and UX designers, developing a full-stack application with Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Node.js and streamlining production with a continuous integration pipeline and unit testing with Jest. In my other freelance project for Walking on a Dream, I’m leading a team of 4 programmers and UX designers to define a project scope and business needs to develop a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) full-stack, mobile-friendly e-commerce website.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Prior to my freelance work, I self-taught coding through Codecademy courses before deep diving into the world of web development. During a rigorous 450 hours of instruction and additional self-guided exploration, I developed several applications using React and Vue for the frontend and MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express, and Node.js for the backend. Working both independently and in teams, I improved my skills in collaboration, creativity, and complex problem solving in a fast-paced production environment.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>With my ability to bridge the gap between technical skills and storytelling, I am eager to create engaging and impactful web applications that connect communities and drive positive social change.</p>
