            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br></br>
            <p>I am a full-stack software engineer with strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills who thrives in collaborating with cross-functional teams.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>With a passion for climate and social impact, I work on the engineering team at Bayou Energy building a suite of APIâ€™s for companies to effectively deploy clean energy devices across many utilities. Utilizing Python, Django, and OpenAI technology, I develop scripts to fetch and parse utility bills and interval data to extract essential utility information for customers.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>As an active Out in Tech member, I collaborate closely with a software engineering mentor to gain professional insight and build a project utilizing Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Node.js to calculate tax credits and deductions for schools converting to clean energy for their buildings and other assets or making them energy efficient. </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Working both independently and in teams, I'm improving my skills in collaboration, creativity, and complex problem-solving in a fast-paced production environment. With my ability to bridge the gap between technical skills and storytelling, I am eager to create engaging and impactful web applications that connect communities and drive positive social change.</p>
