            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br></br>
            <p>I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for digital storytelling, social equity, and environmentalism.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>My near decade of experience in communications for non-profits, grassroots organizations, and local news outlets has honed my ability to create and share information that empowers communities to drive change. At The Daily Northwestern, I analyzed 30 years of data, interviewed dozens of experts and business leaders, and produced an <a href='https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/12/22/multimedia/lead-on-a-federal-rule-full-of-holes/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>investigative podcast</a> on Evanstonâ€™s <a href='https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/12/22/in-focus/lead-on-loopholes-in-federal-lead-law-left-5th-ward-in-the-dark-about-what-is-in-its-water/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>biased lead testing</a>, providing environmental activists in the community with critical insight that pushed the city to <a href='https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/01/29/city/lead-on-a-city-resolution/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>mandate representative testing</a>. At the Coalition for Property Tax Justice, I spearheaded daily social media posts, weekly email campaigns, and targeted ads on Facebook to promote a <a href='https://youtu.be/uZw3DDIaiyQ' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>virtual political action event</a> that reached over 2,000 registrations and 30,000 viewers, putting pressure on political leaders in Detroit to stop overtaxing homeowners.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Throughout my career, I gained experience in web development, working on website redesigns, digital stories, mass email campaigns, and project management tools that increased outreach and made information more accessible for various projects. My love for web development led me to pursue a software engineering immersive program to hone my technical skills. During a rigorous 450 hours of instruction and additional self-guided exploration, I developed several applications using React and Vue for the frontend and MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express, and Node.js for the backend. Working both independently and in teams, I improved my skills in collaboration, creativity, and complex problem solving in a fast-paced production environment.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>With my ability to bridge the gap between technical skills and storytelling, I am eager to create engaging and impactful digital experiences that connect communities and drive positive social change.</p>
